        <p class="message">"em can you believe that it has been 2 months in a day from when you‚Äôre reading this em . so fast . I think we‚Äôre starting to learn more about each other . I really think playing games with you helps with that a lot . anh still think anh y√™u em nhi·ªÅu h∆°n but it isn‚Äôt a competition as long as we both love each other . I was wondering if there is anything you would want us to work on individually or is there anything you want to work on together ? may is only 4 months away but if em mu·ªën come here earlier and will not disagree hehe ‚ù£Ô∏è. we can make anything happen as long as we do it together . I hope even through hard times either in our life individually or together we don‚Äôt give up and continue working tougher to make it through ü•π."</p>
